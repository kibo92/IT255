                    <p class="section-paragraph">The concept of the hotel was born from the owner’s desire to be part of Belgrade’s renovation, impressing a luxurious, but more familiar character to the city, where in the last two decades only big hotels from international chains, not committed with the city’s identity came to sight.
                    <br/><br/>
                    MET hotel Belgrade is a contemporary construction which integrates within the neighborhood by matching colors and respecting height of the surrounding buildings.
                    <br/><br/>
                    The interior design applies materials such as stone, bronze mirrors and wood claddings, both light and dark colored, which results in a very cozy ambient and the most elegant atmosphere.</p>
